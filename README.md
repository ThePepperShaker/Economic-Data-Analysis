# Economic Data Analysis
A school project analysing economic data using R. The course was a first course in R which was mainly focused on learning the principles of data analysis and visualization. 

## Components of this assignment 
1. The first part consisted of tidying a messy dataset and aggregating and visualizing the data 
2. The second part was a programming assignment to create a function to seasonally adjust a time series 
3. The third part required analysis of various sources of economic data 
# Section 1 - Tidying, analyzing and visualizing data 

This part involved a messy datasetand our task was to use the [tidy data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) principles to 'tidy' the data. Finally, we were asked to analyze and visualize the data using techniques which we deemed appropriate.

# Section 2 - Function for seasonal adjustment of a time series 

Here, we had to write a function that takes in a time series and is able to remove the seasonal component. We were also asked to write pseudocode to accompany this. 

# Section 3 - The main part of the assignment - Economic Data 

Part A 
Analysis of data on unemployment rates (comparing genders and comparing registered and survey data) 

Part B
Analysis of data on poverty rates and analysis of a poor data visualization.
